        At the moment, there are one thousand images from which to draw. Our intention is to grow the archive as new books arrive on our shelves and as we continue to scan the books we already have. The process is wonderfully slow on the back end, and exhilaratingly fast on the front end.

        We hope that you enjoy it.
