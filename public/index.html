      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        All the images in this website are scanned from the books on our studioâ€™s shelves.
      </p>

        It is a tool designed to be used during the process of coming up with new ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also just a game, a fun game of chance,
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a machine of random art juxtapositions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its purpose is to tickle and delight the imagination, to spark millions of invisible connections with just a single click.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a triangle: the left image, the right image and you.

        Your subconscious is called upon to see what is between the two.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the moment, there are one thousand images from which to draw.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our intention is to grow the archive as new books arrive on our shelves and as we continue to scan the books We already have. The process is wonderfully slow on the front end and exhilaratingly fast on the back end.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope that you find good use for it.
